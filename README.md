# IntelliJ Plugin for Android Parcelable boilerplate code generation

This tool generates Android [Parcelable](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html) implementation based on fields in the class.

## Installation

Project was built using Java 7 compiler so ensure that you are running your IntelliJ using Java 7 to avoid problems.
Download ParcelableGenerator.jar, go to IntelliJ *Preferences* -> *Plugins* -> *Install plugin from disk...*.

## Usage

Just press alt+insert in editor and select Generate Parcelable. It allows you to select
fields, which will be serialized.

## Supported parcelable types

* primitive types - ```long, int, float, double, boolean, byte, String```
* primitive type wrappers (written with ```Parcel.writeValue(Object)``` - ```Integer, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, Byte```
* primitive type arrays ```boolean[], byte[], char[], double[],  float[], int[], long[]```
* std java serializable types: ```Date, BigDecimal```
* list type of any object (**Warning: validation is not performed**)

## TODO:

* support for Parcelable fields parcelation
* validation of list arguments
* display warning about not serialized fields
* map and bundle support
* sparse array support
* Active Objects support (Binders and stuff)
